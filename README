Visualization of the Lorenz Attractor
s will increase s, d will decrease
b will increase b, n will decrease
r will increase r, t will decrease
arrows will move everything around
- will zoom out, + will zoom in
esc will quit

to compile, go into the directory and enter:
>make clean && make lorenz
this will output lorenz.o, then:
>./lorenz.o

This compiles and runs on Mac OSX as well as Slackware Linux.  I see no reason why it wouldnt work on Ubuntu
